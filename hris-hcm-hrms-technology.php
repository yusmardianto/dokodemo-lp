                    <p>HRIS technologies or Human Resources Information Systems are a type of software allowing users to digitally manage, track and automate the core needs of an HR department.</p>
                    <p>HRIS platforms are usually utilized as central databases capable of storing a large amounts of employee data.

Apart from that, HRIS technologies also offer the ability to perform reporting or analytics at a basic level.</p>
                    <p>So, if HR software possesses the following capabilities, it can be said that it utilizes features of HRIS technology:</p>

                    <p>HRMS or Human Resource Management Systems are a type of technology that includes all the features offered by both HRIS and HCM systems, though with additional payroll and TLM (Time and Labor Management) features.

                    <p>When choosing an HR software to incorporate within your company, you must first adapt it to the specific needs of your company.

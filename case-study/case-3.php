                        <li>
                            <p><b>Q: </b>Why did you want to implement Dokodemo-Kerja?</p>
                            <p><b>A: </b>We provide accounting and consultation services for our client companies. Presently, we have more than 100 clients and due to the nature of our industry, salary payments at the beginning and end of the month, THR, at the beginning of the year and April (when determining the annual tax amount) are our peak business seasons. However, during other months or in the middle of the month, there isn't much work to be done. <br>
                            But, because it is still necessary to secure resources for the busiest times, there is always a surplus of employees during the middle of the month or when workloads are low. Even then, during the beginning and end of the month many employees still have to work overtime, meaning that an increase in overtime work payments cannot be avoided. <br>
                            In this type of business, it is difficult to adjust the number of employees according to busy work periods, so I thought about ways to balance the amount of work with the inevitable overtime. It was then that I heard about LOGIQUE’s company using a more efficient way of increasing productivity with a "40 hours a week" system. <br>
                            We, like LOGIQUE, thought that we could effectively control shifts during peak work times by applying more flexible working guidelines. First, working periods were changed so that the core time was set to 6 hours, with the remaining 2 hours allocated during the busier seasons. <br>
                            Even now, I regularly optimize our existing work regulations. ”Dokodemo-Kerja" has become an indispensable tool for optimizing our new work hours.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><b>Q: </b>What was the reaction from the employees?</p>
                            <p><b>A: </b>Some employees responded negatively because they felt that their overtime wages would decrease. But, on the one hand, they also realized that they didn’t need to waste their time in the office when there was no work, and could spend more time with family, friends, or on their hobbies more often. They also understood that there were other advantages, such as being able to better organize their monthly schedules. Employee satisfaction increased over time, as employees became more aware of the benefits of the new system where they could work according to their individual lifestyles and workstyles. Now, our employees are more motivated than ever, and on a side note, probably because of the benefits offered by this new system had spread by word of mouth our company saw an increase in job applications from similar industries. It improved the level of synergy within our company. 
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><b>Q: </b>What points should be considered when implementing new regulations for this system?</p>
                            <p><b>A: </b>Every employee is different when adapting to new company rules and working systems. Therefore, it is important to carefully convey or repeat any explanations to employees who are not as quick in understanding these new rules, or have any difficulties in changing their methods of work. <br>
                            There might be some negative responses at first, such as "I don't want to use it" or it is "too difficult" to apply the necessary changes, but eventually adapting to the new rules will become a habit, and over time any negative attitudes will disappear on their own. Overall, I think that in handling the first set of obstacles, we must remain very firm. <br>
                            Importantly, I think it is crucial not to implement the changes all at once, but to apply them through various stages, giving each and every employee the time to gradually adapt to the new system. This is to let people understand that implementing it is not a direct imposition by management or HR, but rather an overall optimization strategy done while communicating with the entire organization. Seeing the results obtained over time while implementing these changes, you will eventually receive positive and productive feedback from your employees. In our company, I have repeatedly explained the importance of using Dokodemo-Kerja, in order to analyze the basis needed to implement the system.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><b>Q: </b>It’s been about a year since you’ve introduced the new system. Have there been any changes between the time immediately after its introduction and now? </p>
                            <p><b>A: </b>It has been a year since the change was introduced and the positive effects been continuous. I have continued to monitor employee reactions and adjust existing rules accordingly, so even after one year I think it has remained effective. The number of employees continues to fluctuate, but because there isn’t a big difference in how the application is used, it can still be utilized by new employees effectively and flexibly. By the way, "Dokodemo-Kerja" is not used for sales staff who spend most of their time away from the computer, but since a mobile app version was just released recently, I would like to try it in the near future. 
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><b>Q: </b>I see. So far, most employees who use Dokodemo-Kerja are involved in accounting consultation work, right?</p>
                            <p><b>A: </b>Yes, it is used by around 60 consultants and administrative staffs. Three people from the HR department are also using the software as admins. Regarding the HR department, we have decided each person to be in charge, and through Dokodemo-Kerja, they observe and evaluate the productivity of each employee.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p><b>Q: </b>What is the feedback from the HR department?</p>
                            <p><b>A: </b>There was a negative reaction at first, but after getting used to it, it has now become a positive and supportive addition to their jobs. Initially, they were hesitant to use it because they already had a lot of work to do, and having to check everyone’s Dokodemo-Kerja seemed like a large addition to their workload. However, after introducing it, the opinion in HR has changed, as their existing work which involves counting work hours and matching it with evidence was helped by the application. Therefore, they developed a positive mindset about this change. Because “Dokodemo-Kerja” also acted as a deterrent for prolonged rest periods or doing things unrelated to work, the number of these issues has decreased. We are also able to carry out work that is highly efficient, and as a result, I think the overall organizational skills of the HR department have improved. 
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>Thank you for your valuable feedback.</li>

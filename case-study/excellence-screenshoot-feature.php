                    <p class="mb-0">“In order to use Dokodemo-kerja effectively, employees are required to use the application the way it was intended. When the user forgets to press the "Stop" button during a break, it can cause multiple screenshots to be taken sequentially, and thereby distort the total number of recorded working hours for that day. Therefore, we recommend that the administrator immediately contact the user so as to confirm if there are 3 successive identical screenshots taken by the system; some new features available on Dokodemo-kerja can make this confirmation process a lot easier.”</p>

                                    For companies that are in charge of many employees, of course, it will be quite difficult to do this type of management (dynamically monitor employee screenshots). Therefore, we have developed a new feature that can automatically recognize and notify the user whenever the system detects the same 3 screenshots.

                                    After getting a confirmation from the administrator, and it further becomes clear that the employee in question was engaged in other types of work (eg. Being on the phone with a client), regardless of the screen remaining stagnant with Dokodemo-Kerja still on, then you don't need to take any action. However, if you do forget to press the "Stop" button then you will need to edit your working hours within the system in order to restore your proper working hours.

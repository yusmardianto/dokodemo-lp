                        What are WFH Strategies?
                        </h3>

                        <p>WFH (Work From Home) strategies allow your company’s workforce to freely conduct their work through flexible means, allowing for a wide variety of benefits , from saving money on office space, improving employee work-life balance to increased productivity, as has been shown through a variety of studies, notably from Gallup and Stanford. Unfortunately, without the use of digital technology to keep track of employees and their productivity, results may vary regarding the outcomes of each strategy. However, there exists a wide variety of tools to assist the WFH process. </p>

                        The Standard Setup:
                        </h3>

                        <p>Working from home allows your workers to conduct their tasks from anywhere. However, this work strategy requires certain key elements to support distance based employment. Specifically, workers must use a fully functional laptop, as well as utilize a stable internet connection so that coordination can be conducted efficiently. Also, within this workframe, rules that outline exactly what is expected of remote working employees must be enforced and must be made clear. For example, more stringent consequences can be upheld for infringements such as for absenteeism or failing to submit projects on time, which balances the relative freedom provided by WFH strategies.</p>

                        Better Technology, Better Management:
                        </h3>
                        <p>This is the standard scenario for a successful WFH strategy. However, to further reinforce your remote work strategy, further controls must be applied. Technology available today can now efficiently replicate the company’s ability to track, analyze and report on the attendance and overall  performance of a workforce, making the effort of managing one working remotely a simple and straightforward task. Such software provides an all-in-one solution to distance based employment; some features include: attendance management , recording work hours as well as screen and desktop capturing & monitoring features.</p>

                            <p class="fs-14">The traffic jam that I experience every morning I leave for work can be stressful, to say the least. My house is quite far from the office and I have to take a crowded bus to get there. Everyday totals to about 4 hours on the road. That’s why I was so grateful when my company finally decided to use Dokodemo-Kerja and implemented systems of remote working in my office. With this new application, I can work anywhere I choose, and can further assign  those 4 hours that would be otherwise wasted on being stuck in traffic,on productive activities.</p>

                            <p class="fs-14">I’ve always wanted to go back to university to finish my degree. Through
                            Dokodemo-Kerja, I can prove to my manager that I am still able to work for 8 hours every day.
                            Somedays, I work in the morning, and other times, I work at night. I can now continue my studies
                            while still being gainfully employed. Dokodemo-Kerja has increased the quality of my life. Thank

                            <p class="fs-14">On occasion, I’ve noticed that some of my employees were having
                            unusually long breaks during their allotted prayer time. I just want everyone to have fair
                            working hours, no matter their religion, but it’s difficult for me to talk about this specific
                            issue. Since we have implemented Dokodemo-Kerja, all of my employees now have fair working
                            hours. When it comes time for their prayer break, they will always
                            stop their Dokodemo-Kerja and start it once again when returning to work. Indeed, the
                            application helps our company stay productive.</p>

                            <p class="fs-14">It used to be so difficult to get my employees to stop spending their
                            working hours browsing social media, watching YouTube videos or even playing games. In this
                            respect, Dokodemo-Kerja has become an indispensable tool. Its ability to capture the desktop
                            activities of each employee makes them manage their working hours in a more efficient manner.
                            Now, when engaging in activities other than work, employees will pause their Dokodemo-Kerja.</p>

                            <p class="fs-14">I used to think that working remotely full time was absurd. I mean, if
                            everybody is working remotely, how do we know if they are honestly putting in any working hours?
                            But ever since we’ve implemented Dokodemo-Kerja, we haven’t had to worry about such problems
                            anymore. Such a system makes it possible for us to monitor how each of our employees spend their
                            working hours. Dokodemo-Kerja has indeed helped our company for the better.</p>

                            I’m a new mom and have reservations about trusting my newborn son with a babysitter while
                            working at the office. I’m really happy with Dokodemo-Kerja in this regard as now, my company
                            allows me to work from Home. Now, I can work while taking care of my baby throughout the day.</p>

                            such occasions, they are not working according to their agreed upon hours. I simply want my
                            employees to work in a reasonable manner. After using Dokodemo-Kerja, employees now carefully
                            regard the time that they use at work smoking. I can also easily calculate their overall working
                            hours, as well.</p>

                            for me to work remotely from home. I can still tend to my mother, while working as a full time

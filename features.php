                    <div class="testimony-text">Sometimes I noticed my staffs were having a break too long on prayer time. I just want everyone to have fair working hours, no matter what religion they believe in, but it’s difficult for me to discuss about it. Since we use Dokodemo-Kerja, all employees have fair working hours. If it’s time to have a praying break, they always stop the record and start again when they get back to work. Dokodemo-Kerja helps our company so much to stay productive.</div>

Not only are these features effective in improving the efficiency of HR work overall, such as in regards to attendance management, the calculation of overtime pay, and calculating paid holidays, but it also enables the introduction of more flexible work styles, such as remote work and reduced working hours. As a result, this leads to increased employee productivity.</p>

                    <p class="fw-semibold text-center">Dokodemo-Kerja is an attendance & work content management system with work-time tracking features (based on a screenshot taking function). Not only are these features effective in improving the efficiency of HR work overall, such as in regards to attendance management, the calculation of overtime pay, and calculating paid holidays, but it also enables the introduction of more flexible work styles, such as remote work and reduced working hours. As a result, this leads to increased employee productivity.</p>

                            <p class="features-desc">The system will take a screenshot once, randomly within every 10 minutes. For reasons of privacy, the saved screenshot is of low resolution, therefore, any text found within, such as from emails or message tools cannot be read. The purpose of the screenshot is to determine the application or website type currently open: whether it is work related, YouTube, a game, etc. It also sends a notification to the admin when a user has the same screenshot taken 3 times in a row.</p>

In addition, with the use of Dokodemo comes the hope that the companies that use it will enjoy the likely benefits of increased employee productivity, the use of a more flexible work system, and the ability to help employee performance appraisals be a more fair and objective process. </p>
                    <p>Some of the features utilized by Dokodemo-Kerja are as follows:</p>
                    <ol class="list-item">
                        <li class="mt-3">
                            <h3 class="list-item-title">Attendance and attendance management features</h3>
                            <p>Dokodemo-Kerja comes with online attendance (e-absensi) features. You can use this to track and find out when employees have started and stopped working.</p>
                            <p>Apart from that, Dokodemo-Kerja is very compatible with employees who are required to work through remote systems. Further, because Dokodemo-Kerja functions also as an attendance tool that is presented in software form, employees can therefore install Dokodemo-Kerja on their devices and have their attendance recorded in real time without having to come to the office. </p>
                            <p>This feature collects employee attendance information as well as records the total accumulated employee working hours during a certain period. With Dokodemo-Kerja, one can also see the number of leaves, sick days, or other types of days off proposed by employees, who can further propose such days off via the application as well.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li class="mt-3">
                            <h3 class="list-item-title">Self-Service for employees</h3>
                            <p>Dokodemo-Kerja provides employees with independent access to a variety of things regarding their own data kept in the company. The self-service features provided by Dokodemo-Kerja includes the ability to apply for leaves and days off, view one’s total working hours for any particular day, see the amount of leave days that one has left, and delegate tasks when employees are on leave.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li class="mt-3">
                            <h3 class="list-item-title">Personnel tracking or employee tracking</h3>
                            <p>To ensure that employees work productively, Dokodemo-Kera provides an efficient tracking feature. </p>
                            <p>When using this HR software, the system collects screenshots of its users during random intervals of their work hours. This feature is provided deliberately so that the company and HR team can more easily monitor those under its employ. However, so as to maintain a degree of user privacy as well, the screenshots collected have a low image resolution so that the text within emails or other communication tools cannot be read.</p>
                            <p>Besides being able to take screenshots at random, we also provide employee monitoring capabilities through a GPS feature. This application can thus monitor your employees working on a mobile basis, such as your marketing team, for example. By installing Dokodemo-Kerja on one’s mobile device, the activities of employees working away from the office will be thoroughly monitored.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li class="mt-3">
                            <h3 class="list-item-title">Reports and analysis</h3>
                            <p>The data provided by Dokodemo-Kerja is available in the form of a simple and easy to read report. The company or HR team are able to analyze reports based on an employee’s attendance history, desktop screenshots, and GPS tracking results. Through such reports, the HR team can thus analyze the overall performances of its employees.

                        <a href="/">Dokodemo-Kerja</a> takes its name from both the Japanese and Indonesian languages, with “Dokodemo” meaning “Anywhere” and “Kerja” meaning “to work”, which then translates to “Work Anywhere.” This is reflected on its main function, as it allows for employees to work in an environment most suited to them, instead of being confined to a single location, while efficiently monitoring their daily working routines.

                    <h2>WHY DOKODEMO-KERJA?</h2>

                    <p>
                        For businesses operating from Jakarta, a city well known for its high levels of traffic congestion, coming to work late has become a pervasive part of millennial culture. We aim to change that.
                        <br><br>
                        A case study conducted by Stanford University Professor Nicholas Bloom has shown that, through incorporating ‘Working from home’ strategies, a number of relevant improvements were observed, such as:
                    </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Employees who worked remotely were working a ‘true’ shift (Or for even longer), as opposed to arriving at the office late and leaving early on multiple occasions. These results support the fact that working from home is overall, less distracting for employees, and facilitates longer and better quality work sessions.</li>
                            <li>Employee attrition had decreased by 50 percent among staff working remotely. They also took shorter breaks, had fewer sick days, and took less time off.</li>
                            <li>Companies could greatly reduce their expenses by lowering the amount of office space they used.</li>
                        </ol>

                    <p>
                        By implementing work rotation schedules, <a href="/">Dokodemo-Kerja</a> can prove to be a powerful tool to help reducing costs, maximizing workforce potential and promoting a productive work environment.

                        With accurate work time data, you will be able to evaluate your employee based on his/her work. Those who puts in more time, completes more tasks, and doesn't slack off as much would be rewarded more than those who visibly neglects their job.

Some employees might not feel too comfortable working in a cubicle, and works more productively outside.

                    <p>One of the most common concern for employers and employees alike is maternity leave. Employees will be gone for at least 6 weeks or more, and even then, would they still have their job? Using Dokodemo-Kerja, the employee can rest assured, knowing that they can still keep their job, and work from the comfort of their own home.</p>

                        Disasters always come at the most unexpected time. Whether it's floods, thunderstorms, car accidents, flat tires, children falling ill, road maintenance, the list goes on. In situations like these, employees are forced to not go to the office or even be late for hours.
                        <br><strong>With Dokodemo-Kerja, employees no longer need to worry about being stuck in traffic, being late, or transportation breaking down, because they can now work from home.</strong>

                        Everyone has a special circumstance as to why they can't go to the office. Maybe they need to take care of their child's school administration, register their driver's licence, open up a bank account, or maybe to extend their passport's validity. A lot of these activity should be done in the weekdays. They could be using that time to work remotely instead of spending it sitting in a waiting room for hours.

                    <p>
                        It is perhaps a bit unfair to treat every employee equally if half of them spends most of their work time smoking, watching entertainment videos, taking hours of lunch breaks, or pray longer than necessary. With Dokodemo-Kerja, you can accurately track their breaks and working hours, as they can pause the time tracker when they are not really working.

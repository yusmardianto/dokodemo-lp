                    <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
                    <p class="about-us-desc">Dokodemo-Kerja is a Human Resource tool developed by PT Logique Digital Indonesia, a digital solution company based in Jakarta, Indonesia. This program was made to help employees achieve their best potential.
                        <br /><br />
                        The name Dokodemo-Kerja comes from 2 languages: "Dokodemo": anywhere (Japanese) and "Kerja": to work (Indonesian), which translates into "Work Anywhere". It means that with this program, you or your employee would not be restrained to a cubicle or an office at all times.</p>
                    <p class="about-us-contact">We use the program in our company, and if you wonder how it works in real life, do <a href="contact-us.php">CONTACT US</a> and we will explain how we utilize this tool.</p>

                    <h1>WHY DOKODEMO-KERJA?</h1>
                    <p>The purpose of this program is to promote healthy and productive work culture aimed at highly populated city. In Jakarta, Traffic Jam has become a huge problem, and arriving late at the office has became a "millenial culture". We are aiming to change that.
                        <br><br>
                        Additionally, if a big office space seems too take up too much of your profit away, it might be time to consider an alternative. Employees who live more than 10km away from the office could really use a break from time to time, without affecting their job performance.
                        <br><br>
                        With a proper work rotation, Dokodemo-Kerja could be a decent solution to retain current workers, and promote a healthy work environment.</p>

                            One of the most common concern for employers and employees alike is maternity leave. Employees will be gone for at least 6 weeks or more, and even then, would they still have their job? Using Dokodemo-Kerja, the employee can rest assured, knowing that they can still keep their job, and work from the comfort of their own home.</p>

                            Some employees might feel pressured to go to the office despite their medical illness in fear of losing their job. There have been many cases where people are unwilling to take &quot;sick leave&quot; and go to the office with high fever or a cold, disregard their, and their co-worker&apos;s health. Some people even fall into medical debts for losing their job due to a temporary disability.

                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            Everyone has a special circumstance as to why they can't go to the office. Maybe they need to take care of their child's school administration, register their driver's licence, open up a bank account, or maybe to extend their passport's validity. A lot of these activity should be done in the weekdays. They could be using that time to work remotely instead of spending it sitting in a waiting room for hours.</p>

                        <p>
                            It is perhaps a bit unfair to treat every employee equally if half of them spends most of their work time smoking, watching entertainment videos, taking hours of lunch breaks, or pray longer than necessary. With Dokodemo-Kerja, you can accurately track their breaks and working hours, as they can pause the time tracker when they are not really working.</p>
